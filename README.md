# dhanadatms_mobile_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

"lib" folder is missing which actually contains main.dart file, which is the main file. You can manually add the folder to your workspace and add the main.dart file in it( you will get that on google if search for the it, when you actually create a flutter project.) 
A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
